        I have always had an interest in technology, and in the past 3 years I
        have been experimenting with projects, and helped friends and family
        with tech-solutions.

        <br />
        Besides working on these projects, I am currently enrolled in a
        pre-course for data-engineers. This course includes subjects like math-
        and physics for enginers improving my understanding of the engineering
        field.
